   ![](https://math.now.sh?from=30=200\lambda)

   ![](https://math.now.sh?from=\lambda=0.15\mathrm{m})

2. The distance between compressions for a particular sound source is 1.3m, and the speed of sound is 333m/s through the air. What is the frequency of of the sound source.

   ![](https://math.now.sh?from=f={333}\times{1.3})

3. Compare a sound wave to a light wave.

   - Both transfer energy.
   - Light waves are self-propagating while sound waves require a medium.
   - Sound waves are produced by oscillating particles while light waves are produced by oscillating charged particles.

4. Explain why its impossible to have a mechanical wave in vacuum?

   - Mechanical waves require a medium to transfer energy as they rely on the oscillation of particles causing a physical interaction with eachother unlike light waves which are charged particles that can self-propagate with or without a medium.

5. What is the relationship between period and frequency?

   - Period and frequency are inversely proportional. 

   - Period is the time between one oscillation.

   - Frequency is the amount of oscillations in one second.

6. Define reflection, refraction and diffraction.

   - Reflection is the change in direction of a wavefront when colliding and bouncing off a surface.
   - Refraction is the change in direction of a wavefront when passing through a medium to another.
   - Diffraction is the spreading of a wavefront when encountered with an aperture or opening in a surface.

7. Describes what happens when two waves of the the same amplitude approach each other from opposite direction 180 degrees out of phase. Use three diagrams to show, before, during and after the waves pass by each other.

   - A consequence of the waves colliding when one is 180 degrees out of phase is wave interference.
   - In this situation the negative amplitude would cancel out the positive amplitude, creating an amplitude of zero.

8. Explain how a standing wave is formed?

   - A standing wave is formed when the reflected wave and the incident wave interfere and form a wave with 0 velocity and constructive interfereance.

9. Explain the difference between a node and an antinode.

   - An antinode is maximum displacement of amplitude and the node is zero displacement of amplitude.

10. What is the relationship between the gap width and the amount of diffraction. (angular frequency, ω = frequency/2π)

    - (page 165)

11. A wave with wavelength λ passes through a gap of width w in a barrier. How will the following affect the amount of diffraction that occurs.

    \(a\) λ increases

    ​	When the wavelength increases the 

    \(b\) λ decreases

    \(c\) w increases

    \(d\) w decreases

12. What is resonance.

13. What is driving frequency?

14. Explain what happens during the Doppler effect.

    - The doppler effect is the change in frequency of a sound when the relative velocity of the observer and the source are different.
    - The doppler effect is caused by the waves arriving at the source becoming more frequent (compressing) and less frequent (decompressing).

15. Two waves one with a frequency of 200Hz and the other with a frequency of 250Hz, what is the frequency of the beat.

16. - Beat frequency is the absolute difference of two frequencies.

      ![](https://math.now.sh?from=f_B=\lvert{200-250}\rvert)

      ![](https://math.now.sh?from=f_B=50\mathrm{Hz})

17. Describe what happens to the sound intensity as distance from the source is increased.

    ![](https://math.now.sh?from=I=S/4\pi r^2)

    - As distance from the source increases the sound intensity falls off because the energy is spread over a larger surface area.
    - For example: If you double the distance, intensity falls off by a factor of 4.

18. (a\) What is the fundamental frequency of a string that is 3m long and has a speed to 10m/s.

    \(b\) What is the frequency of the second harmonic.

19. (a\) What is the resonant frequency formula for a closed tube.

    ![](https://math.now.sh?from=f_n=\frac{(2n+1)v}{4L})

    (b\) If the tube is 1.2m long and the speed of sound is 330m/s, find the resonance frequency?

    ![](https://math.now.sh?from=f_1=206.25\mathrm{Hz})

20. \(a\) What is the resonant frequency formula for a open tube.

    ![](https://math.now.sh?from=f_n=\frac{2}{n}\times{L})

    \(b\) If the tube is 2.2m long and the speed of sound is 330m/s, find the resonance frequency?
